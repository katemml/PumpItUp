# PumpItUp
Clean water is a universal human right and is a prerequisite for the pursuit of many other public health problems.
The goal of the competition is to classify water pumps as functional, non functional, or needing repair.
If this classification could be successfully applied on live data, it could help inform the assignment of resources to repair efforts, improving the percentage of the population who have access to clean water.
Outside data not allowed.
Our group proposes to enter the DrivenData ‘Pump it Up’ competition for our final project. The problem posed by this competition is one of classifying water pumps in Tanzania as functional, functional but needing repair, or nonfunctional. The data comes from the Taarifa waterpoints dashboard, which crowdsources data concerning the maintenance of these water pumps to community level efforts and organizations. For the purpose of the DrivenData contest a dataset of approximately 70,000 records from 2015 is provided. Each data point, representing a singular water pump, has 39 attributes, almost all of them categorical. which present information such as geographic location, who constructed it, and engineering details.
